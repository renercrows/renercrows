### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Maximiliano Ungredda
#### Software Developer

### I'm currently available for hire or open to new job opportunities.

I am a Full-Stack software developer passionate about making unique code that creates solutions. Connecting client and server is my daily routine, as I'm currently working on multiple projects related to front-end and back-end. One of the most important aspects of the process is connecting the frontend with the backend through an API, something that I do in most of my projects. On my daily, not only work with coding, also need to work with others, something that brings me important skills such as leadership, effective communication, problem-solving, time management, etc. I am a fast learner that can keep up with the most demanding tasks, and also great at adapting to other people's work flows. I am always up for a challenge, solve difficulties, and get the best result possible.
